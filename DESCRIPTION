    time series of counts
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: "Graham Mueller <wgmueller@gmail.com> [aut, cre]"
Description: Time-series of count data occur in many different contexts. A
    Markov-modulated Poisson process provides a framework for detecting
    anomalous events using an unsupervised learning approach.
